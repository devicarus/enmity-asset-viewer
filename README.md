## FAQ
>**Q: But.. there are no asset types in the Asset API, how do you know what's an icon?**<br>
A: The viewer considers it an icon if it's name starts by `ic_` or directly contains the word `icon`.

>**Q: What about assets that are not icons?**<br>
A: The support is planned, but not a priority. A lot of the assets are pretty big, so the current list view used for icons won't cut it anymore.
